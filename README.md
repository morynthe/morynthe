### Hi there! ^-^

#
About me: completed a course at [School 21](https://21-school.ru/) as Manual Quality Assurance Engineer. 🌱
- 🔭 I'm currently looking for opportunities to test my testing skills (~~pun intended~~)

<summary> Work in progress ⏵ </summary>

```
Initially, the Github account was more for training bc I was stored everything on the computer locally.
Now here I will add updates to present as a resume and examples of my work for employers.

🙇 I hope for your understanding! 🙇
